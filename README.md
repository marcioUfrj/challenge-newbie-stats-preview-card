## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS @media

### What I learned

- How to use flexbox and css grid.
- How height and width works between parent div and children div, really nice.

### Continued development

I wish to learn more about sizing and positioning div in order to be faster to code.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Figma](figma.com/) - This is an amazing tool to calculate the aproximate size of margin, padding, height and widths.
